Short Term:
* Improve testing files.
* Look into using Latex package Hyperref
* Make section\section* an option.  Perhaps automate TOC building.
* change 'index.html' default behavior.
* Possibly rearrange POD documentation.

Long Term:

* Make it run on Windows better/also.
* Give more TeX options, and header style, and a table of contents and such.
* Parsing of more HTML options, esepcially meta information in the HEAD.
* Right an automated installer. 

Things left to test:
* All options
* Consistancy of options between objects.
* Alternate config files
* Good debugging info
* Alternate stores
