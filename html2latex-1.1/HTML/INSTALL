Make sure before you do anything else that you install requirements.
See README for more information.  After you're done with that try the
classic:

perl Makefile.PL
make install

That should just install it.  Although, I recommend:

perl Makefile.PL
make test
make install
make clean

It's more safe (it's tested) and more clean (it's cleaned).
