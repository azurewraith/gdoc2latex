Introduction
------------

html2latex converts a valid HTML file to (hopefully) a valid latex
one.  There is also on option to create a pdf automatically, so this
could be called "html2pdf".  If you just want something like that,
look for "html2ps" at freshmeat.net.

Information
-----------

For usage, try "./html2latex -h" or "perldoc html2latex.pod".  For
installation and further information, read INSTALL.
